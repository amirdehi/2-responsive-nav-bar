# 2-responsive-nav-bar


## Short Description:

Create a stylish, mobile-friendly navigation bar with a hamburger menu for smaller screens. The navbar should adapt seamlessly to different device sizes and include hover effects for enhanced interactivity.


## Full Description:

A responsive navigation bar is essential for modern websites. In this challenge, you'll design and implement a fully functional navigation bar that adjusts based on screen size, using CSS for responsiveness and JavaScript for interactivity.

Features to Include:

Desktop View:

A horizontal menu with navigation links aligned neatly.

Links should change appearance (e.g., underline or color) on hover.

Mobile View:

A compact hamburger menu icon replaces the horizontal menu.

Clicking the icon reveals a vertical dropdown menu with the same links.

Ensure smooth animations for the dropdown transition.

Styling Enhancements:

Add a logo to the left side of the navbar.

Use a gradient background or a clean, modern color palette.

Provide feedback effects (e.g., hover effects, active states).

This challenge will help you practice responsive web design principles, learn media queries, and handle basic JavaScript events.


## Technologies or Tools You Might Need:

HTML: For the structure of the navigation bar.
CSS: For styling, hover effects, and responsive design using media queries.
JavaScript: For toggling the hamburger menu.
Browser Developer Tools: For testing responsiveness.
